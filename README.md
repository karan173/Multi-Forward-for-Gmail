##FAQs

1. *Is there a daily limit on the number of emails one can forward using the extension.*  
  Yes. A total of about 100 mails can be forwarded in a day using this extension. This limit is imposed by Google itself. However, if you have a Google Apps for Work/Edu/Gov account, then you can forward about 1500 mails per day.

2. *What permissions are necessary for this extension to work and why?*  
  While authentication the extension, the user must agree to grant the following permissions-

  a. View and manage your mail.
  This is needed because the extension needs to forward the emails. Note, this permission could have been more granular, but  it is not so because of a limitation with Google Apps Script.

  b. Know who you are on Google.
  The extension needs to know your identity (email id).

  c. View your contacts.
  This is needed to autocomplete email recipient suggestions.

  d. View and manage data associated with the application.
  This is needed since the extension stores the number of emails you have sent in the current day for better error reporting.

3. *Where should I report issues?*
